# dji_h20t_rpeg_to_tif

## Description

The DJI H20T creates thermal images (infrared) in a format, which is not compatible with current photogrammetric pipelines (e.g., Agisoft Metashape, Pix4D). Moreover, the DJI thermal data should be first calibrated according to emissivity, relative humidity and camera-target-distance. This procedure enables to convert entire folders from *.rtpeg to *.tif format while doing the calibration on the fly. The procedure is based on DJI Thermal SDK.
